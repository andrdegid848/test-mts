### Task
1. Write a parser (backend) of all public MTS tariffs (Internet communications, TV) using the link
“Tariffs” are higher in their parameters, options, prices and can be aggregated into any storage (from
file to any database) or a table view.

3. Implement a front that displays the results available in the store and a button
“Parse”, which starts the data update process.

5. If possible, the front should be able to display parsing results with filters and
sorting. Ideally, it should allow you to choose the desired tariff conveniently
way.
